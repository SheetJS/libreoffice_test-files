= Directory structure =

This directory and its sub directories contain all kinds of test documents for
Calc.  They are organized by content types or test themes, but *not* organized
by file types.  The reason why they are not oragnized by file types is to make
it easier to test, for example, importing of identical contents from different
file types, such as .ods, .xls, and .xlsx, while in the same directory.
