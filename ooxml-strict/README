HOWTO run all of this:
======================

You've obviously cloned the git repo already. You'll now want to
generate the Python binding classes from the schema. cd into this here
directory, and issue:

make

That'll spew loads of python files into wml, sml, pml etc. subdirs
inside this directory. And afterwards run a demo iteration with the
Lorem-ipsum.docx file. Inspect results in your /tmp/ dir.

How to write your custom iteration rules: look into demo.py, you'll
basically want to hack the 'worklist' list of regular expressions -
all schema types matched there will get iterated. See *.xsd files for
the corresponding XMl schema type names.

More advanced stuff to follow.
